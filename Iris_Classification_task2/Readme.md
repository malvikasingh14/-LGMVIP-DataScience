<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn40w.png">

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools(sklearn). 
The algorithm used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy is Dicision tree classifier 
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).

PS: Drop a star if you like it!
